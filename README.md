# My Cola 3D Product Showcase

A web-based 3D application for showcasing Coca-Cola brand beverage products, built with Three.js and Bootstrap 5.

## Project Overview

This 3D Product Showcase was developed as a university assignment for 3D Applications Development. The application allows users to view and interact with 3D models of Coca-Cola brand beverage containers using modern web technologies and responsive design principles.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Model Viewing**: Three different Coca-Cola product models with detailed textures
- **Camera Controls**: Rotate, pan, and zoom to explore models from any angle
- **Visualization Modes**: Toggle wireframe mode to see the geometric structure
- **Animation Controls**: Enable/disable auto-rotation
- **Lighting Adjustments**: Controls for ambient light, directional light, and spotlight
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Expand the 3D view for a more immersive experience
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- **Content Tabs**: Switch between product description, gallery images, and video
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick access to common functions

## 3D Models

The showcase includes three detailed Coca-Cola brand beverage container models:

1. **Coke Can**: Classic red Coca-Cola can design with iconic branding
2. **Fanta Can**: Bright orange container with vibrant Fanta branding
3. **Sprite Bottle**: Green-tinted transparent bottle with contoured design and Sprite logo (enhanced complexity model)

All models were created using Blender and exported in GLB format for web optimization.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Modern markup and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering library
- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive UI framework
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library
- **Blender**: 3D modeling software (for creating the 3D models)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
